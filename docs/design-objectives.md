# Local first

The solution is designed firstly to run locally on a user's device and is not dependent on centralised or third party hardware, servers or resources.

# Open standards

The solution uses open standards and specifications so that it can be created and used openly by different tools and in different ways.

# Platform and vendor agnostic

The solution is not tied to or coupled with a closed platform or the services of a vendor.
